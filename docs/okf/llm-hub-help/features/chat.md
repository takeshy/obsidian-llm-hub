# AI Chat

Open chat from the ribbon, the command "LLM Hub: Open chat", or "LLM Hub: Toggle chat / editor". Enter sends a message, Shift+Enter inserts a newline, the stop button aborts generation, the plus button starts a new chat, and the history button loads previous chats.

Slash commands are reusable prompt templates. They can insert `{selection}` and `{content}`, override the model or search setting, and are triggered by typing `/`. The default `/infographic` command turns selected or active-note content into an HTML infographic.

Mentions are inserted by typing `@`. `{selection}` expands to the captured editor selection when sent, `{content}` expands to the active note content when sent, and file mentions insert vault paths that the AI can read through tools.

Attachments can include images, PDFs, text files, audio, and video. Files are sent to Gemini as inline data where supported.

Vault tools let the AI read, create, search, rename, edit, and delete notes and folders. Editing and deletion use proposal tools by default: the user must approve changes before they are applied. Tool mode controls are:

- Vault: All - all vault tools.
- Vault: No search - read/write tools but no search or list tools.
- Vault: Off - no vault tools.

Chat can also use web search, selected RAG stores, MCP servers, active skills, and active OKF knowledge.

Chat history is stored as Markdown files under the configured workspace folder when history saving is enabled.
