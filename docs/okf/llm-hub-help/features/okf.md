# OKF Knowledge Sources

OKF is Open Knowledge Format: a vendor-neutral Markdown directory format for curated knowledge. LLM Hub uses OKF as chat context, not as a search index. OKF is best for stable definitions, product knowledge, glossaries, metrics, datasets, playbooks, and domain concepts that should consistently guide answers.

Use OKF when the knowledge should be read as curated context. Use RAG when the assistant should semantically search a larger vault corpus. Use skills when the assistant needs reusable behavior, references, executable workflows, or scripts.

# Bundle Structure

An OKF bundle is a directory tree of Markdown files:

```text
bundle/
  index.md
  log.md
  concept.md
  group/
    index.md
    another-concept.md
```

Reserved files:

- `index.md` - directory listing for progressive disclosure.
- `log.md` - chronological update history.

Every non-reserved concept file should have YAML frontmatter with a non-empty `type` field. Recommended fields are `title`, `description`, `resource`, `tags`, and `timestamp`. Unknown frontmatter fields are allowed and should be preserved.

Root `index.md` may declare:

```yaml
---
okf_version: "0.1"
---
```

# Links and Body

Concept bodies are standard Markdown. Use normal Markdown links to connect concepts. Bundle-relative absolute links such as `/features/chat.md` and relative links such as `./chat.md` are both valid. Broken links are allowed by the OKF spec because they can represent knowledge not written yet.

Conventional headings include `# Schema`, `# Examples`, and `# Citations` when applicable.

# Configure External OKF

Settings -> Knowledge sources contains:

- OKF enabled - turn the external OKF source on or off.
- Directory - vault-relative path such as `Knowledge` or `.Knowledge`, or an absolute desktop path.

Absolute filesystem paths require desktop Obsidian because mobile Obsidian does not expose filesystem access outside the vault.

# Bundle Discovery

LLM Hub discovers selectable bundles by finding directories that directly contain `index.md`. The bundle ID is the directory path relative to the configured root. A root-level `index.md` produces the root bundle. The display name comes from `index.md` frontmatter `title` when present, otherwise the folder name.

Users can select active bundle IDs from chat. The selection of external bundles is persisted on the OKF knowledge source as `activeBundleIds`; the built-in `LLM Hub Help` bundle selection is session-only and is not persisted.

# Prompt Loading

When OKF is active, LLM Hub recursively reads Markdown files from the selected bundle directories. `log.md` is skipped. Each document is summarized into a compact prompt fragment with:

- type
- title
- description
- tags
- path
- short body excerpt

The loader limits each selected bundle to 24 Markdown documents and each body excerpt to 1400 characters so OKF does not overwhelm the model context.

# Built-In OKF

LLM Hub ships a built-in OKF bundle about this plugin. It is always available as the `LLM Hub Help` OKF option in chat, independently of the external OKF setting, but it is injected only after the user selects it or clicks the help question button. Users can then ask chat about LLM Hub setup, chat tools, skills, workflows, RAG, OKF, MCP, dashboards, settings, security, and troubleshooting without configuring an OKF directory.

The source copy for the built-in bundle is the English OKF bundle under `docs/okf/llm-hub-help/`. During `npm run build` and `npm run dev`, `scripts/generate-builtin-okf.mjs` reads that bundle, skips `log.md`, compacts each document, writes a gzip+base64 generated module, and the chat loader expands it as the built-in `llm-hub-help` bundle.

# Relationship To RAG And Skills

OKF is prompt context. It is not embedded or indexed for semantic search. RAG stores are local embedding indexes searched by similarity. Skills are instruction bundles that may include references, executable workflows, and scripts. These can be combined: OKF supplies domain knowledge, RAG retrieves large document evidence, and skills guide behavior or run workflows.
