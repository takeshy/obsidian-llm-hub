# Workflow Triggers and Inputs

Workflows can run manually, from hotkeys, from Obsidian events, as dashboard widgets, as sub-workflows, or as skill workflow tools called from chat.

# Hotkeys

To enable a hotkey, open the workflow file, click the keyboard icon in the Workflow panel footer, then assign the command in Obsidian Settings -> Hotkeys. The workflow filename is used as the hotkey display name.

When a hotkey run reaches `prompt-file`, it uses the active file automatically. When it reaches `prompt-selection`, it uses the current selection or the full active file content if no selection exists.

# Event Triggers

Event triggers can run workflows on:

- `create` - file created.
- `modify` - file modified, debounced.
- `delete` - file deleted.
- `rename` - file renamed.
- `file-open` - file opened.

Triggers can include a glob file pattern such as `**/*.md`, `journal/*.md`, `*.md`, `**/{daily,weekly}/*.md`, or `projects/[a-z]*.md`.

# Event Variables

Event-triggered workflows receive:

- `_eventType` - event type.
- `_eventFilePath` - path of the affected file.
- `_eventFile` - JSON with path, basename, name, and extension.
- `_eventFileContent` - file content for create, modify, and file-open events.
- `_eventOldPath` - previous path for rename events.

For event runs, `prompt-file` and `prompt-selection` automatically use the event file; `prompt-selection` uses the entire event file content.

# Skill Workflow Inputs

For skill workflows, any variable read via `{{var}}` before it is initialized by a `variable` or `set` node and before it is written by `saveTo` becomes an input variable. LLM Hub extracts these inputs and writes them into the skill's `skill-capabilities` fenced block as `inputVariables`.

The chat model sees these input variable names when deciding how to call `run_skill_workflow`. Skill instructions should reference each input by exact variable name.

# Dashboard Workflow Inputs

Workflow widgets run headlessly from dashboards and render cached Markdown or HTML output. They should not rely on interactive prompt nodes because no user interaction is available during background refresh. The output should be stored in a string variable, usually `result`.
